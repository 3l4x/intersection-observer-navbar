# Intersection Observer Navbar

This project I made in 2021 to practise the Intersection Observer API. It changes the style of a navbar as the user scrolls through different sections of a webpage. I refactored and changed the code a bit on 1/21/2023.

View live demo [here](https://3l4x.github.io/intersection-observer-navbar/)

## Features

- Uses IntersectionObserver API to detect when the user has scrolled to a new section of the page (callback will be triggered at 10% and 80% section visibility, scrolling up and scrolling down is separated)
- Changes the style of navbar (Based on which section we are on. If we are on an odd numbered section nav has header-inverse class)
- Smooth scrolling
- Basic styling with css


## Requirements

- Modern webbrowser with Intersectionobserver API



## Usage

- Clone or download repo
- Open index.html in a browser
- Scroll and see how the navbar style changes based on sections.
